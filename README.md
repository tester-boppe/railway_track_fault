This deep learning-based defect detection system classifies images as Defect or Non Defect using a fine-tuned EfficientNet-B0 model. Built with PyTorch and deployed via Streamlit, it allows real-time image classification. Optimized with AdamW, the model achieves 98% accuracy and is ready for deployment on Streamlit
